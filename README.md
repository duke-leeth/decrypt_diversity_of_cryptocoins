## Week 1 Deliverable
### Project Idea (1-sentence)
To provide a real-time cryptocoins analysis platform for data scientists to retrieve information , and offer a tools for portfolio diversification and risk reduction.


### What is the purpose, and most common use cases?
Whenever investors want to reduce the risk by diversifying portfolio, they need to know the correlation between all the investment targets. However, unlike the stock market, in which all the correlations have been well studied, correlations between different cryptocoins haven't been well understood yet. Moreover, the correlations may change in different time period. To meet this desire, I decide to build the platform.

1. A Tool for data scientists to acquire cryptocoin historical data.
2. An information provider system for real-time portfolio management system.

* Kafka
